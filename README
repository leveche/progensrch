Query input format (Sample query also provided separately):

1               # 0: Neutron Star or 1: Black Hole
0.0,8.0         # Donor Mass Range (Msol)
6.0,14.0        # Accretor Mass Range (Msol)
-15.0,-4.0      # log10(MT Rate) Range (Msol/yr)
0.0,100000.0    # Orbital Period Range (days)
3.0,5.0         # log10(Donor Effective Temperature) Range (K)

Enter the quantities in order, if you don't have error estimates for a quantity, enter limits that span the entire range of possible values.

Query name is entered as a command line argument, run using:

python3 query.py sample_query.txt
