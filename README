All simulation data files are stored in /home/chatriks/pickle_runs_mesh/*m*p folders

Query input format (Sample query also provided separately):

0.0,7.0		# Donor Mass {Msol}
7.0,10.0	# Accretor Mass {Msol}
-15.0,-4.0	# log10(MT rate) {Msol/yr}
0.0,100000.0	# Orbital Period {days}
3.0,5.0		# log10(Donor Effective Temperature) {K}

Enter the quantities in order, if you don't have error estimates for a quantity, enter limits that span the entire range of possible values.

Query name is entered as a command line argument, run using:

python3 query.py sample_query.txt
